## Running the Experiments

### Part I: Survey
**Software:** 
(1) Qualtrics templates for the survey are stored in the folder "qualtrics". These contain both .qsf files (importable in Qualtrics) and PDF files showing the overall survey flow for reimplementation in other platforms.
(2) A Python notebook used to analyze the data, using the following package versioning:

**Data:** 


## Part II and III: Interactive Experiments
**Software:** 
(1) Qualtrics templates for the interactive experiments with the GPT API are stored in the folder "qualtrics". These contain both .qsf files (importable in Qualtrics) and PDF files showing the overall survey flow for reimplementation in other platforms.
(2) A Python notebook used to analyze this data.

**Data:** The output of these experiments were: (1) a
